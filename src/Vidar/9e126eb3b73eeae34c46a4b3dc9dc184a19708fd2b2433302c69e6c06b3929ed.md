To start Analysis, I put updater.exe in %LOCALAPPDATA%.
Uncheck "DLL can move" in DllCharacteristics.
Load malware inside x32dbg

Checking the strings of malware, C2 server's http address can be seen:

And as it can be seen from strings, malware utilizes third string as user_agent.

Now the important part for us is, `CreateProcessW` which creates another process of itself from same directory. My guess is, it is used for avoiding detection, later current process will write memory of child process:

<img src="https://github.com/basicacc/basicacc.github.io/blob/main/My_analysis/Malware_3/Logger_Stealer/2.png?raw=true" width="1000">

in our case, 0x43C is handle to child process and `0x3FC0E60` is address of the data that will be written into `0x400000` and size is `0x400`, this WriteProcessMemory will happen a lot of times in a row, especially in  7 times a row:

<img src="https://github.com/basicacc/basicacc.github.io/blob/main/My_analysis/Malware_3/Logger_Stealer/3.png?raw=true" width="1000">

I dont want to list all `WriteMemoryProcess` as later we can just check `0x400000` in child process if needed. The last `WriteProcessMemory` address is `0xE4F008` (changes everytime).

as we move along, `ResumeThread` function is called in parent process, which will start the logger (child process). I attach debugger to child process and continue process in parent process.

After checking strings of child process, it can be seen, it needs 149 functions from these dlls:
kernel32, ntdll, advapi32, user32, gdi32, shell32, ole32, ws2_32, shlwapi, wininet, bcrypt, dbghelp, msvcrt

Now the important part starts for us at `0x417210`, analyzing this process step by step is a little difficult because of so many unnecessary/necessary jumps, there is just a lot, so it doesn't help. Even just putting breakpoints over the functions that process will call, can be easier. 

Later in process, a new directory will be created under `C:\ProgramData\` with random name. (in my case `y5ppz`) 

InternetCrackUrlA will be called to crack https://t.me/l793oy into components

InternetConnectA used to connect `t.me` using handle returned by InternetOpenA

HttpOpenRequestA sends request using handle to t.me:

<img src="https://github.com/basicacc/basicacc.github.io/blob/main/My_analysis/Malware_3/Logger_Stealer/4.png?raw=true" width="1000">

After `t.me`, process will do same things for `https://e.mx.goldenloafuae.com` which I suspect is C2. some sandboxes, analyzers didn't specify this url and at the moment this server is down.

As `https://e.mx.goldenloafuae.com` is still up, it was obvious that malware was sending, getting encrypted data. Such paths that were queried by malware were:


"C:\\Users\\eyes\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\*.*"
"C:\\Users\\eyes\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Local Extension Settings\\nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn\\*.*"

Later the files that were found would be copied into the folder that was created by malware:

CopyFileA (function used)
1: "C:\\Users\\eyes\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Local Extension Settings\\nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn\\000004.log"
2: "C:\\ProgramData\\y5ppz\\jmgvk6ppph4e"

After sending files to attackers, malware deletes files.

I will also attach 1 example file that was copied (which is hard to make sense).

Also don't forget, in my case only `Chrome` was installed, so it only stole its logs. The malware looks for:

1. **Microsoft Edge**
    
    - Path: `\Microsoft\Edge Beta\User Data`
        
2. **Google Chrome**
    
    - Path: `\Google\Chrome SxS\User Data`
        
3. **Microsoft Edge SxS**
    
    - Path: `\Microsoft\Edge SxS\User Data`
        
4. **Epic Privacy Browser**
    
    - Path: `\Epic Privacy Browser\User Data`
        
5. **CocCoc Browser**
    
    - Path: `\CocCoc\Browser\User Data`

and the reason it checks extensions is:
1. **TON Wallet**
    
2. **MyTonWallet**
    
3. **Alephium Wallet**
    
4. **Solflare**
    
5. **Trust Wallet**
    
6. **Hashpack**
    
7. **Leap Terra**
    
8. **Authenticator**
    
9. **Bitwarden**
    
10. **Oxygen (Atomic)**
    
11. **Ecto Wallet**
    
12. **Morphis Wallet**
    
13. **GeroWallet**
    
14. **UniSat Wallet**
    
15. **Pontem Wallet**
    
16. **Xverse Wallet**
    
17. **Venom Wallet**
    
18. **PaliWallet**
    
19. **Fluvi Wallet**
    
20. **Backpack Wallet**
    
21. **OKX Web3 Wallet**
    
22. **HAVAH Wallet**
    
23. **OpenMask Wallet**
    
24. **Rainbow Wallet**
    
25. **SafePal Wallet**
    
26. **KardiaChain**
    
27. **RoninWalletEdge**
    
28. **NamiWallet**
    
29. **KeePass Tusk**
    
30. **Frontier Wallet**
    
31. **Bitget Wallet**
    
32. **CyanoWallet**
    
33. **Ronin Wallet**
    
34. **MetaMask**
    
35. **Talisman Wallet**

as it was clear how malware was functioning, I stopped analyzing.
There were other notable functionalities of malware such as mapping hostnames of AVs to 127.0.0.1 so user will not be able to use any AV (Download or online check)

My suspicion is "https://t.me/l793oy" and "https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199829660832" are used for C2 server
