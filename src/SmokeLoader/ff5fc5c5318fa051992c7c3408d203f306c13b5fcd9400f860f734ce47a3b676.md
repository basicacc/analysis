I started analyzing the malware for a day, mostly using dynamic analyse tools. Normally the file that is downloaded is around 100kb but after unpacking itself, it is around 30kb. We need to put hardware breakpoint at `0x401ae0` to be able to dynamically debug program. (Note: I also put software breakpoint but after breakpoint hit, I removed it for further analysing).
Also I dumped process to ghidra, so I can do static analysis too. If you check memory in x32dbg or SystemInformer, everything can be Read/Written/Executed. That's why it can rewrite itself.

NOTE: The reason, we must not use software breakpoint is, it modifies malware's code by adding `CC` at start of the assembly code, unpacking the code will cause issues.

Later analyzing the code, I realized some parts of the executable is still encoded, I let malware execute itself till `0x401BCD` so it can decode these parts, then dumped. Which later, I realized it didn't really decode and check ghidra again for any tips. There it is, code is actually decoding -> executing -> encoding itself. (Polymorphic) Which is why I couldn't do static analyzes:

What I will actually do is, again execute code but now, I will stop at when the part is executed so I can copy and paste it into my dumped exe file. For example, `0x40410a` etc.

Alright so, I changed bytes of the parts we need for further analyzing. the first function at `0x40410a` is putting functions' address from dlls to uninitialized DATAs:

(it is longer)

It will not be really hard to rename DATAs in ghidra to function names for static analysis. Which is what I am going to do next.

After Renaming variables, it is a lot more easier to do static analysing but there are still some functions that use `decoder()` function in itself. That means I have to also rewrite their bytes.

Okay so as I progress, I try as much as I can to do static analysis and understand each function, I did few discoveries and 1 of the important ones is:
![1|500](https://github.com/basicacc/basicacc.github.io/blob/main/My_analysis/Malware_5/14.png?raw=true)

As I renamed, it checks for file name and returns accordingly, in our case as I run it first time with random name, it will return `0x10` but there are other possibilities too, which I might check if needed. That's the exact way malware searches for file names:

Which is not that hard to understand.

Sadly, while analysing this malware, I had to take break for a while (final exams in university) so I couldn't focus on the malware. But I can say, I did important parts like decoding some parts, to explain what the dropper part does is, (not really dropper because malware itself is actually as a whole doing everything) just delete WinSrv32 file and terminate any process with this name, write itself (or a part of itself), I couldn't analyse these parts as I dont have a lot of time. then start executing itself from there. I will provide smokeloader ghidra zip, because I believe it is not something to drop in trash, maybe 1 day I might come back and look into this and finish the job. I dont really know. (ghidra zip is in same folder as this file). (also provided dd32 file to know where the breakpoint has to be).
